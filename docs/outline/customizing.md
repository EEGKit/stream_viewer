The provided renderers expose many parameters that can be set at initialization and many of those can be modified at runtime. Check each renderer's `__init__` signature, as well as its parents', to see the available parameters.

Additionally, StreamViewer provides control panel widgets for many of the renderers to facilitate real-time changes to the parameters. These are used by many of the [example applications](../modules/applications/overview.md).

TODO: Double-check the renderers' control panel widgets.
